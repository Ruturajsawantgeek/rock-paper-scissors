This is a rock-paper-scissors game with a simple UI and animations.

This project taught me a ton! Some of the big ones:
- Using **setTimeout** and **setInterval** to make repetitive animations and events that synchronize with them.
- Making **event listeners** temporarily disable themselves to stop task interruption.
- Using **flexboxes** within flexboxes to make responsive layouts. **Grid** was also explored but was ultimately removed when it proved redundant for this project.
- Using **CSS media queries** to aid with responsive design.
- Using viewport units to implement **responsive font size**.
- Using **immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)** to eliminate global variables.

My next task for this project will be to make it even more responsive, i.e. mobile-ready.

See prototype.html for a stripped-down version of the game with no UI; it is played entirely with prompts and alerts.
